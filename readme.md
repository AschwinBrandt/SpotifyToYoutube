Spotify To Youtube
Import all the songs in a Spotify playlist to a Youtube playlist.
Tested on Mac OS 12.16.3 with Python 3.9.16

To do:
- User selection of spotify playlists and YT playlist name
- Fetch quotas of YT API and remember where in the import process the script was for a future run
- Add music information to the YT playlist notes
- Fix OAUTH redirect so that the access key doesn't need to be copied by the user
- Run in Docker container to support cross platform
